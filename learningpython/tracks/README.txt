Musical Track Database
This application will read an iTunes export file in XML and produce a properly normalized database with this structure:

CREATE TABLE Artist (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    name    TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Genre (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    name    TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Album (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    artist_id  INTEGER,
    title   TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Track (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
        AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    title TEXT  UNIQUE,
    album_id  INTEGER,
    genre_id  INTEGER,
    len INTEGER, rating INTEGER, count INTEGER
);

To grade this assignment, the program will run a query like this on your uploaded database and look for the data it expects to see:

SELECT Track.title, Artist.name, Album.title, Genre.name
    FROM Track JOIN Genre JOIN Album JOIN Artist
    ON Track.genre_id = Genre.ID and Track.album_id = Album.id
        AND Album.artist_id = Artist.id
    ORDER BY Artist.name LIMIT 3
The expected result of this query on your database is:

Track	Artist	Album	Genre
Chase the Ace	AC/DC	Who Made Who	Rock
D.T.	AC/DC	Who Made Who	Rock
For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)	AC/DC	Who Made Who	Rock

"11"	"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)"	"AC/DC"	"Who Made Who"	"Rock"
"18"	"Hells Bells"	"AC/DC"	"Who Made Who"	"Rock"
"41"	"Shake Your Foundations"	"AC/DC"	"Who Made Who"	"Rock"
